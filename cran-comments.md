## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 19 downstream dependencies
(<https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/blob/master/revdep/README.md>).
There was one problem with a vignette build with the test suite for camtrapR - but is unrelated to this package.

------

This version is a few bug fixes and improvements.

Thanks!
